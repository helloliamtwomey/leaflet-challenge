# Leaflet Challenge - Earthquake Visualisation

## Introduction
This project visualises earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) on an interactive map using Leaflet.js and D3.js libraries. The visualisation consists of two parts:

- Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation
- Part 2: Visualise Tectonic Plate Data

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file to display the interactive map.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `logic.js`: The JavaScript file containing the code for creating the interactive map and visualizing earthquake data.

## Usage
To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in the chrome web browser. 

All necessary dependencies are loaded in the `index.html` file.

## Results

### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation
The resulting interactive map displays earthquake markers reflecting their magnitude by size and depth by color. A legend is provided to give context to the map data.

### Part 2: Visualise Tectonic Plate Data
In this part, tectonic plate data is added to the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Additional controls are added to allow users to toggle between different views.
